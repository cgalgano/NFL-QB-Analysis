# Copilot Instructions for NFL QB Analysis Project

## Project Overview
- This project analyzes and ranks NFL quarterbacks (2021–2025) using advanced analytics, play-by-play data, and custom rating models.
- Core data is sourced from `nflfastR` via `nflreadpy` (Python), with additional expert and situational CSVs.
- Main workflows are in Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `qb_ranking_model.ipynb`, `nfl_qb_analysis.ipynb`).

## Code Practices
- Do not put unnecessary print statements.
